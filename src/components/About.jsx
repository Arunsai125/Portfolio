      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Arun Sai Narla â€” a Computer Science graduate from UCF and currently working as a Software Development Engineer at Temenos. I enjoy building scalable backend systems using Java, Spring Boot, and cloud platforms like AWS and Kubernetes. I'm passionate about designing secure APIs, automating deployments, and solving real-world problems with clean code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I actively solve problems on LeetCode and love diving into new challenges. During my time at UCF, I served as Vice President of the Graduate Student Association and co-authored research in AI and computer vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source when I can, and learning ways to write better, more efficient software. Whether it's through hands-on work or side projects, I'm constantly striving to grow as an engineer.
